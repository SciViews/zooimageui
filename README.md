New user interface for ZooImage using Shiny

Lecocq Martin, learning about ZooImage and shiny to create a user interface for ZooImage

You can first source "install.R" to be sure that all required R packages are installed.

Here is the project to create a golem package of a shiny application.
The purpose of this package is to create a User Interface for ZooImage.
=> The data used as training can be downloaded on this link : https://filedn.com/lzGVgfOGxb6mHFQcRn9ueUb/zooimage/zi_data.zip
You can then put the data in your working directory.

Application Version : 1.0.0  


In the Trials folder, there are all my old folders and files in which I made tests of Shiny apps for ZooImage, and tests of ZooImage.

  In the folder "Notes/", you will fin all of my notes and tests made during learning

  In the folder "TI_Test_app/", you will find my first tests of app for ZooImage

  In the folder "R", you will find a script called "data_loading.R" which you can use to download the samples (that are too big for github)
  
  In the folder "Sortable_Test_App/" you will find a test app to try to use sortable (r package for shiny (drag and drop))
  
  In the folder "ZI_Tests/" you will find the place where I trained and learned ZooImage, and the files used to do so.
