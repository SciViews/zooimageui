New user interface for ZooImage using Shiny

Lecocq Martin, learning about ZooImage and shiny to create a user interface for ZooImage


Here is the project to create a golem package of a shiny application.
The purpose of this package is to create a User Interface for ZooImage.
=> The data used as training in ~/shared/data/zooimage_data/ can be downloaded by using the script in Trials/R/data_download.R 
Then, put the data where you need it to be.


In the Trials folder, there are all my old folders and files in which I made tests of Shiny apps for ZooImage, and tests of ZooImage.

  In the folder "Notes/", you will fin all of my notes and tests made during learning

  In the folder "TI_Test_app/", you will find my first tests of app for ZooImage

  In the folder "R", you will find a script called "data_loading.R" which you can use to download the samples (that are too big for github)
  
  In the folder "Sortable_Test_App/" you will find a test app to try to use sortable (r package for shiny (drag and drop))
  
  In the folder "ZI_Tests/" you will find the place where I trained and learned ZooImage, and the files used to do so.
